Run to Give Toronto (RTG) is a non-profit virtual charity run established in 2020. 

Over the past two years, Run To Give Toronto has given people the opportunity to stay active while also lending a helping hand throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. With the support of over 300 participants and donors, the organization has been able to raise over $33,000 for local Toronto charities. 

In 2020, the team put together an event for “Meals to Heal Toronto” in under 3 months, raising and donating over $8,000. This meant that they were able to donate roughly 500 meals to frontline workers in hospitals throughout the GTA while supporting local businesses. 

In 2021, RTG teamed up with “Stella’s Place", who provides comprehensive mental health services for 16 to 29 year olds. In only their second year of operating, RTG was able to raise over $25,000. This gave over 300 young adults the opportunity to utilize Stella’s Places’ drop in counseling and truly made a difference within the local community.

I have the privelege of developing RTG's website which will be used for educational and marketing purposes!
