        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Over the past three years, Run To Give Toronto has given people the opportunity to stay active and make a difference within their community. With the support of over 400 participants and donors, we have been able to raise just over $60,000 for local Toronto charities.</p>
        <p>In 2020, our team put together an event for "Meals to Heal Toronto" in under 2 months. Throughout this time, we saw massive support in our community and were able to donate over $8,000. This meant that they were able to donate roughly 500 meals to frontline workers in hospitals throughout the GTA while supporting local businesses.</p>
        <p>In 2021, RTG teamed up with "Stella's Place," which was designed by young adults, their families, and professionals to provide comprehensive mental health services for 16 to 29-year-olds. In our second year, we were able to raise over $25,000, giving 300 young adults in Toronto the opportunity to experience Stella's Place's drop-in counseling, which truly made a difference for our peers within our community.</p>
        <p>In 2022, RTG supported the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario (POGO), a charity dedicated to supporting children and families going through pediatric cancer. Children facing cancer have unique medical and non-medical needs that are best addressed by specialized pediatric oncology teams. $28,500 was directed towards POGO's support programs, which offer a wide range of services to help children and their families navigate the challenges of pediatric cancer.</p>
