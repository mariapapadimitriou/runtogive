        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Over the past two years Run To Give Toronto has given people the opportunity to stay active and connected while lending a hand throughout the pandemic. With the support of over 300 participants and donors, we have been able to raise over $33,000 for local Toronto charities.</p>
        <p>In 2020, our team put together an event for “Meals to Heal Toronto” in under 2 months. Throughout this time we saw massive support in our community and were able to donate over $8,000. This meant that they were able to donate roughly 500 meals to frontline workers in hospitals throughout the GTA while supporting local businesses.</p>
        <p>In 2021, RTG teamed up with “Stella’s Place” which was designed by young adults, their families and professionals to provide comprehensive mental health services for 16 to 29 year olds. In our second year, we were able to raise over $25,000; giving 300 young adults in Toronto the opportunity to experience Stella’s Place’s drop in counselling which truly made a difference for our peers within our community.</p>
